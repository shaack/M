# M.js

M is a library of JavaScript ES6 (ECMAScript 6) modules, used for coding [chessmail](http://www.chessmail.eu).

The main purpose of modulo is, to prevent the usage of large libraries, and to provide needed functionality with the smallest and cleanest amount of code possible.

The M modules have no external dependencies, they don't use jQuery or other frameworks. They are written with modern vanilla JavaScript in ECMAScript 6 syntax.

The modulo modules are:

- [Audio](https://github.com/shaack/svjs-audio) Module for the [Web Audio API](https://developer.mozilla.org/de/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API). For playing audio samples in a web page.
- [SVG](https://github.com/shaack/svjs-svg) Module to render SVG elements and load sprites.
- [Observe](https://github.com/shaack/svjs-observe) Module to observe object properties used for reactive coding the simple way.
- [Test](https://github.com/shaack/svjs-test) Very minimal module for unit testing directly in your browser.
- [App](https://github.com/shaack/svjs-app) Kind of minimal framework for ES6 JS apps.

These modules are using jsv:

- [cm-chessboard](https://github.com/shaack/cm-chessboard) The Chessboard for chessmail.de, a SVG replacement of chessboard.js
