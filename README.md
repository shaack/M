svjs are ES6 (ECMAScript 6) JavaScript modules, used for coding in [chessmail.de](http://www.chessmail.de).

The main purpose of the svjs modules is, to prevent huge libraries, and to provide needed functionality with the smallest and 
cleanest amount of code possible. All modules are used for coding a chess community with thousands of members and therefore are proved for working.

All svjs modules have no external dependencies, they don't use jQuery or other frameworks. They are written with modern vanilla JavaScript in ECMAScript 6 syntax.

The svjs modules are:

- [svjs-app](https://github.com/shaack/svjs-app) Kind of minimal framework for ES6 JS apps.
- [svjs-audio](https://github.com/shaack/svjs-audio) Module for the [Web Audio API](https://developer.mozilla.org/de/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API). For playing audio samples in a web page.
- [svjs-svg](https://github.com/shaack/svjs-svg) Module to render SVG elements and load sprites.
- [svjs-observe](https://github.com/shaack/svjs-observe) Module to observe object properties used for reactive coding the simple way.
- [svjs-test](https://github.com/shaack/svjs-test) Very minimal module for unit testing directly in your browser.

Created with svjs are:

- [cm-chessboard](https://github.com/shaack/cm-chessboard) The Chessboard for chessmail.de, a SVG replacement of chessboard.js
- [cm-pgn](https://github.com/shaack/cm-pgn) Parsing and rendering PGNs with nags, variations and comments. (Alphaversion, not productive)
