svjs are ES6 (ECMAScript 6) JavaScript modules, used for coding in [chessmail.de](http://www.chessmail.de).

Main purpose of the svjs modules is, to prevent huge libraries, and to provide needed funcionality with the smallest and 
cleanest amount code. All modules are used for coding a chess community with thousands of members and are therefore proved 
for working.

The svjs modules are:

- [svjs-app](https://github.com/shaack/svjs-app) Kind of minimal framework for ES6 JS apps.
- [svjs-audio](https://github.com/shaack/svjs-audio) Module for the [Web Audio API](https://developer.mozilla.org/de/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API). For playing audio samples in a web page.
- [svjs-svg](https://github.com/shaack/svjs-svg) Module to render SVG elements and load sprites.
- [svjs-observe](https://github.com/shaack/svjs-observe) Module to observe object properties used for reactive coding the simple way.
- [svjs-test](https://github.com/shaack/svjs-test) Very minimal module for unit testing directly in your browser.
